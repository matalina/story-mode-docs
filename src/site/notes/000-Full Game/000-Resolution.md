# Resolution 

The basic resolution mechanic is to roll against a set Level for whatever task you are preforming. A player may use any appropriate tag on their character sheet to modify the level of the task.

A player then rolls 1d20 against the DC. The DC is equal to 3 times the Level of the task.

| d20          | Result       | Details                              |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| 1            | Fail, and    | Fail, and things are worse           |
| 2 to DC-6    | Fail, but    | Fail, but something else helps you   |
| DC-5 to DC-1 | Success, but | Success, but not exactly as expected |
| DC to DC+4   | Success      | Exactly as you expected              |
| DC+5 +       | Success, and | Success, and things are better       |

> [!example]
> George wants to pick a lock on a door. The target is level is 4 he would have to beat a 12 without any tags. But  George is a thief, and he has the tag "I can open anything!" these two things ease the target level by one each, lowering the level to 2.  George has to now beat a 6. 
> 
> If George rolls a 2 he gets a "Fail, but" George failed to pick the lock BUT someone opens the locked door from the other side...
> 
> If George rolls a 4 he gets a "Success, but" George successfully picked the lock BUT someone spots him doing so...
> 
> If George rolls a 7 he just picks the lock and the story moves on.
> 
> If George rolls a 12 he gets a "Success, and" George successfully picks the lock and George is inspired by such a great job on a difficult lock. (His next roll is eased)

## Player vs Player Resolution

When a contested roll against two players characters happens both a d20 and add +1 (or the Tiered modifier) for any tag that eases the roll, add -1 (or the Tiered modifier) for any tag that hinders the roll. The player who initiates the conflict is Player A and the other is Player B, using Player A's Total - Player B's Total use the following Resolution table to determine the outcome of the conflict.

| (Player A total - Player B total) | Outcome for Player A    |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| ≤ -5                              | Fail, and               |
| -4 to -1                          | Fail, but               |
| 0                                 | Success, but (tie case) |
| 1 to 4                            | Success                 |
| ≥ 5                               | Success, and            |

## Modifying the Difficulty

The situation and your character tags can modify the target difficulty.  This is done by either easing the difficulty or hindering the difficulty.

**Easing:** Easing the difficulty means that you lower the level of the task being preformed.

**Hindering:** Hindering the difficulty means that you raise the level of the task being preformed.

Remember that the target number (DC) to hit is 3 times the level, so the target number is essentially lowered or raised by as many times as the task is eased or hindered.

## Levels of Difficulty

| Level | DC  | Description  |
| ----- | --- | ------------ |
| 0     | 0   | Routine      |
| 1     | 3   | Simple       |
| 2     | 6   | Standard     |
| 3     | 9   | Demanding    |
| 4     | 12  | Difficult    |
| 5     | 15  | Challenging  |
| 6     | 18  | Intimidating |
| 7     | 21  | Formidable   |
| 8     | 24  | Heroic       |
| 9     | 27  | Immortal     |
| 10    | 30  | Impossible   |
