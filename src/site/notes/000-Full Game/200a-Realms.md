New Everlight is a hodge-podge of a city. Concord Square is a dense, vertical metropolis dominated by towering skyscrapers.  Neon lights illuminate the streets of The Neon Quarter.  Everlight Commons offers rare moments of nature amid the chaos of the rest of the city. Art Deco building and Spanish style homes style the neighborhoods The Gilded Mile creating a unique blend of architectural diversity. Urban flats is a contingent of happy little brownstones lining the streets. Elysium Heights shimmers with neon lights that outshine the sun, the bustle and move at all hours. Runestone plaza filled with brick-clad greystones, industrial lofts and historic bungalows.  The Ironworks is a striking contrast from the rest of the city with its industrial grit. The Ivory Ward is known for its progressive spirt, intellectual energy and the eclectic culture and sometimes weird things happen around Ashcroft University.
