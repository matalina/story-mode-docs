# New Everlight

Approximate Coordinates: 44.1894857108483, -106.81077274944631
~3mile long, ~1mile wide

Average Population: 214K

**Whispering Message:** "Magic is everywhere."  
**Crisis:** In response to rising global instability linked to unregulated magic, the Arcane Compression Doctrine is being introduced by multiple nations—including the U.S. The NEAA, under federal pressure, begins quietly enforcing far more aggressive magical restrictions, targeting even Tier I and II casters under the guise of “proactive containment.”
**Why:** To protect a Magical Nexus of Ley lines

New Everlight is a modern city in today's world with the exception that magic is real, everyone knows it exists but it is not accessible to everyone. New Everlight has the same technology that exists today with the addition of magic. New Everlight is a big US city like New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. There are underlying factions. There is the Faerie Mound, which connects New Everlight to the Wyld. And a Shadow Rift that connects it to the Nether. Supernatural creatures dwell in the shadows, and some even right out in the open.
