### The Revelation

On July 4, 1984 magic was revealed to the world through a televised broadcast when magic transported a young boy into Everlight Commons Park breaking the veil between worlds and a tiny portion of the Wyld erupted through the rift created before the boy returned home. After which during the remaining chaos a Dragon took flight revealing the existence of the Drakari. This event became know as The Revelation. 

After the Revelation, the Ferai began searching for more power and magic and tore a rift into The Nether.
