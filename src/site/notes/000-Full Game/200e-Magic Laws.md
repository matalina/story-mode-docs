# Magic Laws

## Magical Restrictions

#### 1. Mandatory Registration of Practitioners
- Anyone using magic above a certain level (typically Tier II or above) must be registered with the [[000-Full Game/200c-Factions#New Everlight Arcane Authority\|New Everlight Arcane Authority]] (NEAA).
- Registration includes your magical school(s), known capabilities, and any supernatural affiliations. 

#### 2. Ley Line Usage Permits

- It is illegal to tap directly into ley lines for personal or commercial purposes without a sanctioned permit.
- Unauthorized ley siphoning is a federal-level felony, treated like environmental terrorism.

#### 3. Prohibition of “Wild” or Unstable Magic

- Spells that alter time, bend space, cross dimensions, or summon entities from the Wyld or Nether are forbidden without oversight.
- Enforced by Arcane Stabilization Units (a specialized branch of magical enforcement).

#### 4. Ban on Public Mind Manipulation

- Enchantments or charms that influence thoughts, memories, or emotions are outlawed in public areas.
- Consent-based spells require magical contracts (often notarized magically by a Guild official).

#### 5. Restricted Species & Creatures

- Familiars and summoned entities (especially from the Faerie Mound or Shadow Rift) must be tagged and warded.
- Certain species are considered "dangerously magical" and cannot be brought within city limits without containment protocols.

#### 6. Magical Concealment Laws

- Use of glamours or illusions to impersonate another person or hide your identity in public is illegal.
- Exceptions exist for licensed performers or under approved security clearance.

#### 7. Artifact Possession Restrictions

- Cursed, ancient, or "anomalous" magical artifacts must be reported and either registered, surrendered, or contained.
- Possession of unregistered magical relics is grounds for search and detainment.

#### 8. Public Casting Hours

- Non-emergency spellcasting in public areas is restricted between midnight and 6 AM unless part of a licensed event.  
- Designed to prevent ritual gatherings, underground rites, or summoning during lunar hours.

#### 9. Mandatory Spell Tracking for Businesses

- Commercial magic must be logged via licensed tracking sigils. Businesses that use magic without proper tracking face heavy fines or seizure of assets.
- Applies to potion shops, charm vendors, healing services, and magi-tech integrations.

#### 10. Nexus Preservation Mandate

- All magical activity within a one-mile radius of the Magical Nexus is monitored in real-time by a city-wide scrying ward.
- Unregulated activity near the Nexus may result in detainment or memory alteration under the Arcane Emergency Powers Act.

## Newly Added Regulations

### 1. Ancestral Affinity Registration Act (AARA)

- Anyone with magical bloodlines must register even if they don’t actively cast.
- DNA-magic affinity testing becomes quietly mandatory for government workers and students in elite programs.

### 2. Arcane Citizenship Reform

- Magic-using immigrants must pass magical ethics screenings and surrender any unstable relics or familiars before citizenship approval.
- Some supernatural lineages may be excluded from permanent residency due to “dimensional instability.”

### 3. Emergency Suspension Clause (ESC)

- During heightened magical alerts, all magic use may be temporarily suspended, including public healing and shielding spells.
- City-wide nullification fields are being tested in pilot zones, especially around the Nexus.

### 4. Faerie and Nether Border Regulations

- Travel to/from the Wyld or Nether now requires a cross-dimensional passport and proof of magical containment training.
- Re-entry wards require you to pass through scrying checkpoints. Some beings are denied reentry outright.

### 5. Expanded Nexus Zone Surveillance

- The 1-mile Nexus ward has been expanded to 3 miles. Magical drones now patrol the skies.
- Any “spikes” in magical resonance are treated as pre-terror events, even if accidental.

- Registration: Optional, but encouraged for civic jobs or magical employment.
- Notes: Home-use spells, neighborhood witchcraft, street-level magic.  

### Tier II – Regulated Magic

- Registration: Illegal for individuals. 
- Permitted Only To: Certain research labs, Nexus preservationists, or emergency task forces under strict NEAA control.
- Notes: Possessing Tier IV spell knowledge without clearance is a high felony.

## ## Magical Aptitude Index (MAI)

Each practitioner is also scored 1–10 based on raw power/potential, regardless of what spells they use. So even a Tier I caster with MAI 8 might be watched carefully, while a Tier III caster with MAI 3 is seen as less dangerous.
