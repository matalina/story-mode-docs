# Resolution 

The basic resolution mechanic of Story Mode is to roll against a set Level for whatever task you are preforming. A play may use any appropriate tag on their character sheet to [[000-Mechanics/000-Resolution#Modifying the Difficulty\|modify]] the level of the task.

A player then rolls a 1d20 against the DC. The DC is equal to 3 times the Level of the task.

| d20          | Result       | Details                              |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| 1            | Fail, and    | Fail, and things are worse           |
| 2 to DC-6    | Fail, but    | Fail, but something else helps you   |
| DC-5 to DC-1 | Success, but | Success, but not exactly as expected |
| DC to DC+4   | Success      | Exactly as you expected              |
| DC+5 +       | Success, and | Success, and things are better       |
> [!note]
> If you need inspiration for what your and or but need roll as many times on the inspiration tables until you feel inspired.

> [!example]
> George wants to pick a lock on a door. The target is level is 4 he would have to beat a 12 without any tags. But  George is a thief, and he has the tag "I can open anything!" these two things ease the target level by one each, lowering the level to 2.  George has to now beat a 6. 
> 
> If George rolls a 2 he gets a "Fail, but" George failed to pick the lock BUT someone opens the locked door from the other side...
> 
> If George rolls a 4 he gets a "Success, but" George successfully picked the lock BUT someone spots him doing so...
> 
> If George rolls a 7 he just picks the lock and the story moves on.
> 
> If George rolls a 12 he gets a "Success, and" George successfully picks the lock and George is inspired by such a great job on a difficult lock. (His next roll is eased)

## Player vs Player

When a contested roll against two players characters happens both a d20 and add +1 for any tag that eases the roll, add -1 for any tag that hinders the roll. The higher of the two totals wins the contest.

### Oracle Table

The oracle table is a specialized Level 5 Check with a DC of 15.  Ask a Yes or No question and use the following results to inform your game.

| d20   | Result   | Details                          |
| ----- | -------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1     | No, and  | No, and things are worse         |
| 2-9   | No, but  | No, but there is a positive      |
| 10-14 | Yes, but | Yes, but not exactly as expected |
| 15-19 | Yes      | Yes                              |
| 20    | Yes, and | Yes, and things are better       |

## Modifying the Difficulty

The situation and your character tags can modify the target difficulty.  This is done by either easing the difficulty or hindering the difficulty.

**Easing:** Easing the difficulty means that you lower the level of the task being preformed.

**Hindering:** Hindering the difficulty means that you raise the level of the task being preformed.

Remember that the target number to hit is 3 times the level, so the target number is essentially lowered or raised by as many times as the task is eased or hindered.

## Levels of Difficulty
