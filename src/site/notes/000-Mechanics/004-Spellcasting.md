# Spellcasting

Any player character has access to magic if they so desire. 

If a character's base sentence includes magic under the umbrella tags that make up the sentence Casting a Spell is a Level 3 task, otherwise it is a Level 5 task.

> [!example]
> Tony is a smartass vampire assassin who enforces vampiric law.
> 
> A vampire has some vampire powers which can fall under magic, so he'd need a spell to say mesmerize his food before biting them so they don't yell and scream. He has access to some magics that would be associated with magic.
>  
> Tony could thus cast vampiric magic at a level 3, but any other magic at level 5.
> 
> But what if Tony was just a normal human who enforces the law? 
> 
> Then he wouldn't have access to magic and all his spells would be at level 5.

If a character has a tag that specifies they have access to a specific Aspect of magic the tag eases the task.

A default base spell has the following properties.

**Level:** 5 (15)
**Aspect:** Choose one
**Type:** Choose one
**Effect:** Descriptive of what the spell does
**Range:** 30ft
**Area of Effect:** single
**Targets:** 1
**Duration:** 1 Round
**Cast Time:** 1 action

> [!note]
> A spell may have either a damage or effect. Adding the other costs +1  to the level plus any other modifiers.
> 
> A spell may have either a number of targets or any area of effect and cannot have both.

The chart below details how each option changes the level of the spell increasing the difficulty of it.  A spell's level cannot go above level 10 when creating it. Each spell crafted by the individual has their own unique level.

## Spells

Spells are a combination of Evocation and Domain.  To create a spell choose one from each list and detail what you want the spell to do.  Then you can start with the default spell structure and build it out from there.

When casting a spell you will also need to detail how you are casting it. Are you winging it? Do you have a scroll?  Did you learn it from someone else?  This step is not required if you've used this spell in prior sessions.

### Type

- **Damage** – Harmful effects
- **Counter** – Nullifies or prevents effects (All counter spells should start at instant thus increasing the starting level by 2)
- **Control** – Manipulates forces/objects

- **Ward** – Protection-based effects

##  Casting a Spell

| d20          | Result       | Details                                                                         |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1            | Fail, and    | Fail, and Roll on the Mishap table                                              |
| 2 to DC-6    | Fail, but    | The spell fails, but nothing backfires or goes wrong                            |
| DC-5 to DC-1 | Success, but | Success, but it backfires and hinders all rolls until the end of your next turn |
| DC to DC+4   | Success      | The spell goes off exactly as you expected                                      |
| DC+5 +       | Success, and | Successfully cast the spell and earn the tag of Mastery for that spell.         |
Mastery of a spell eases the level of the spell by one. A spell can only be mastered once.

If you roll a Natural 20 for any DC you also gain Mastery of that spell.

A character may also spend downtime of 2d6 weeks Mastering a Spell.  A character may only study one spell at a time.

> [!example]
> A fire wizard will start at level 3, but the fire tag will ease the level by 1.  And if they have mastered the fireball spell it will be eased by an additional level.  A regular joe casting fireball would cast against a level 7 Cast Spell check, but our fire wizard with mastery would cast the spell against a Level 3 Spell check.

### Blood Magic

Blood magic is rare and evil. Blood magic requires the user to specifically take the tag "Uses Blood Magic" in order to actually have access to it.  It may be applied at Character Creation but must be earned through a Character Arc at any other time.

To cast a spell with Blood Magic you must sacrifice part of yourself or another living creature of the appropriate level.

This sacrifice will ease the spell casting by two and the target sacrifice will gain 1 lingering trauma wound. If the living creature is below level 3 it is instantly killed.  The damage type for this is necrotic.

### Mishaps

Mishaps happen when a spell goes awry.

| 6   | Roll twice on the table and they both happen                                                              |
