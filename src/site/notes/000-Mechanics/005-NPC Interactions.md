# NPC Interactions

* A typical NPC will start at _indifferent_ when meeting an NPC.
* Based on society and faction expectations adjust the relationship.
* Relationships changed based on the interactions.
* When interacting with an NPC any checks should be eased or hindered by the indicated amount.

**First Interaction:** When encountering an NPC for the first time start at _indifferent_ and adjust your relationship based on society and faction expectations.  This is where your character will start the relationship.

**Following Interactions:** Roll a d12. Move the attitude indicator in the direction of the rolled number one step. This is a temporary state and will only last for this scene unless you make a drastic change in the relationship status and it changes permanently. For any modifiers in social interactions use the original disposition, only their current attitude towards you is changed as their mood has.

| Steps | Disposition        | Attitude                |
| ----- | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| +3    | Unbreakable Bond   | devoted, protective     |
| +2    | Unyielding Loyalty | steadfast, supportive   |

| +1    | Loyal              | friendly, dependable    |

At Character creation, any player NPCs and factions will start with a relationship already established.  
* For factions start at _Indifferent_ then you may move the starting relationship one step in any direction.
* For NPCs start at _Indifferent_ then you may move the starting relationship up to two steps in any direction.
