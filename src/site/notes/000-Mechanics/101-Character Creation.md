# Character Creation

A Character in Story Mode is a collection of tags that can ease or hinder game play. 

## Character Sentence 

We lay out your character sentence in the following format, and all tags are in bold.

> [!info] Character Sentence
> \[Name] is a **\[descriptor]** **\[species]** **\[type]** who **\[does something]**.  

All tags in your character sentence are [[000-Mechanics/999-Glossary#^6ca8a3\|Umbrella Tags]]. Umbrella tags house other tags underneath them and mean much more than the single word or phrase they represent.

> [!note]
> If you wish to be a human, you may select a second descriptor otherwise your second descriptor should be your species. Some Settings may have a Human or a Human like descriptor.

> [!example]
> * Eldrin is a cunning elven rogue who weaves shadows into deadly blades
> * Lena is a resourceful private investigator who uncovers secrets.
> * Vex-7 is a rogue AI bounty hunter who tracks fugitives.
> * Dr. Alistair Cogsworth is an eccentric clockwork engineer who builds automatons.

## Background

Chose one tag that represents your background. This can be a specific part of your type, or it can be something else on another spectrum, but it should be something meaningful that plays a big part in who you are.

Choose up to 5 additional tags that describe your character's abilities and additional background. 

> [!note]
> You may leave some blank and add them on the fly in game play up to 5 tags. Quests or other in-game actions award additional tags.

## Flaws

All characters have flaws. A flaw can also have benefits, but it should also hinder a character in some situations.

Choose 1 flaw. 

> [!note]
> It may be beneficial to the player to link the flaw to one of the seven deadly sins -- pride, envy, wrath, sloth, greed, gluttony, and lust. For example, we can link perfectionism to pride, hedonism to gluttony, anger management issues to wrath, fear of missing out to envy, and kleptomania to greed.
> 
> A flaw does not have to only apply negative effects. Perfectionism can be a flaw if it can harm the outcome of a task trying to make it perfect and never knowing when to stop and call it done. However, perfectionism can also ease a task when you need attention to detail and you lack other stressors.

> [!tip] Optional
> You may choose 1 additional flaw and add 1 additional positive tag to add to your character sheet.

## Character Arcs

Characters should start with a Character Arc -- something they are trying to achieve.

## Gear & Wealth

Characters can carry up to ten items and have a starting Wealth of 3.

Characters start with a weapon of choice, armor of choice, and should select a specialized piece of gear. Some settings may require additional items at character creation. 

## Known World Lore

Assume all player characters know two locations.
* Their residence
* Their place of employ or similar location

A character's background, or place of employment (such as city government or a bounty hunter association), may determine their starting faction. The character should have a starting relationship with their faction that is up to two steps from _indifferent_.

A character may have up to three known NPCs (family, employers, contacts, etc.). Assign each known NPC a relationship status up to three steps away from _indifferent_.

## Group Play

If playing with a group either as individual players or as a solo player, the group should figure out how they know each other.  It can be helpful to think about how they met, and why they are all together.  You can also assign each character a relationship status to remind you how your characters interact with one another.
