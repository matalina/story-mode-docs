# Character Creation

A Character in Story Mode is a collection of tags that can ease or hinder game play. 

## Character Sentence 

Your character sentence is laid out in the following format and all tags are in bold:

> [!info] Character Sentence
> \[Name] is a **\[descriptor]** **\[species]** **\[type]** who **\[does something]**.  

All tags in your character sentence are [[000-Mechanics/999-Glossary#^6ca8a3\|Umbrella Tags]].  Umbrella tags house other tags underneath them and mean much more than the single word or phrase they represent.

> [!note]
> If you wish to be a human you may select a second descriptor otherwise your second descriptor should be your species. Some Settings may have a Human or Human like descriptor.

> [!example]
> * Eldrin is a cunning elven rogue who weaves shadows into deadly blades
> * Lena is a resourceful private investigator who uncovers secrets.
> * Vex-7 is a rogue AI bounty hunter who tracks fugitives.
> * Dr. Alistair Cogsworth is an eccentric clockwork engineer who builds automatons.

## Background

Chose one tag that represents your background. This can be a specific part of your type, or it can be something else on another spectrum, but it should be something meaningful that plays a big part of who you are.

Choose up to 5 additional tags that describe your character's abilities and additional background. 

> [!note]
> You may leave some blank and add them on the fly in game play up to a total of 5 tags. Additional tags can be earned from quests or other in game actions.

## Flaws

All characters have flaws. A flaw can also have benefits but it should also hinder a character in some situations.

Choose 1 flaw. 

> [!note]
> It may be beneficial to the player to link the flaw to one of the seven deadly sins -- pride, envy, wrath, sloth, greed, gluttony and lust. As an example Perfectionism could be linked to pride, Hedonism to gluttony, anger management issues to anger, fear of missing out to envy, kleptomania to greed.
> 
> A flaw does not have to only apply negative effects.  Perfectionism can be a flaw if it can harm the outcome of a task trying to make it perfect and never knowing when to stop and call it done. However perfectionism can also ease a task when attention to detail is needed and you have no other stressors applied.

> [!tip] Optional
> You may choose 1 additional flaw and add 1 additional positive tag to add to your character sheet.

## Character Arcs

Characters should start with a Character Arc -- something they are trying to achieve.
## Gear & Wealth

Characters can carry up to ten items and have a starting Wealth of 3.

Characters start with a weapon of choice, armor of choice, and should select a specialized piece of gear. Some settings may require additional items at character creation. 

## Known World Lore

Characters are assumed to have two known locations
* Their residence
* Their place of employ or similar location

Characters may start in one faction if their background suggests it, or is considered their place of employment (ie: city government or a bounty hunter association). The character should have a starting relationship with their faction that is up to two steps from _indifferent_.

A character may have up to three known NPCs (family, employers, contacts, etc.).  Assign each known NPC a relationship status up to three steps away from _indifferent_.
