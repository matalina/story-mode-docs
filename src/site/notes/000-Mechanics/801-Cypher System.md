# Cypher System Conversions

Creatures, NPCs, and Items/Gear are a straightforward conversion. You can turn their abilities into tags and create a basic sentence from their descriptions.

The Character sentence in the Cypher System is almost 100% compatible with Story Mode.

You can turn abilities that are a significant part of your character, coming from your Type and Focus, into Tags. Some Abilities might make better spells.

Abilities that would make better spells should use the abilities accessible Tier in the following equation: Level 3 + (Tier - 1). Use Level 5 if the character is not an innate spell caster with another magical tag in their character sentence.

Consider all Cyphers as Spells, and apply the same rules as for abilities. Level 3 + (Tier - 1) (or Level 5 for non-innate magical characters) Spells cannot go higher than 10, if an cypher pushes the check above a 10, consider it +5 regardless of level.
