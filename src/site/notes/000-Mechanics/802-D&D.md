# D&D Conversion

## Descriptor

In order to account for your rolled stats you should create a descriptor that takes into account your higher or lower stats depending on what you want to focus on.

> [!examples]
> A really low strength could be Weak.
> A really low intelligence could be Dim.
> A really high constitution could be Resilient.
> A really high Wisdom could be Wise.

## Species/Race and Type

Species should be your D&D Race, and your Type should be your class.

## Does Something

Pick one Core Feature of your class, background or character concept that defines your character.  

A Barbarian is implied with "Rages", so pick something else. Swings Heavy Axes is a more appropriate Does something.

A Warlock might choose "Rebels against \[Patron]" as heir sentence finisher.
