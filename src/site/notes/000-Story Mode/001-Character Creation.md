# Character Creation

Create a Character sentence: \[Name] is a \[descriptor] \[species\descriptor] \[type] who \[does something].  

> [!note]
> If you wish to be a human you may select a second descriptor otherwise your second descriptor should be your species.

> [!example]
> * Eldrin is a cunning elven rogue who weaves shadows into deadly blades
> * Lena is a resourceful private investigator who uncovers secrets.
> * Vex-7 is a rogue AI bounty hunter who tracks fugitives.
> * Dr. Alistair Cogsworth is an eccentric clockwork engineer who builds automatons.

Chose one tag that represents your background.  This can be a specific part of your type, or it can be something else on another spectrum, but it should be something meaningful that plays a big part of who you were.

Choose up to 5 additional tags that describe your characters abilities and additional background. 

> [!note]
> You may leave some blank and add them on the fly in game play up to a total of 5 tags. Additional tags can be earned from quests or other in game actions.

Choose 1 flaw. 

> [!note]
> A flaw does not have to only apply negative effects.  Perfectionism can be a flaw if it can harm the outcome of a task trying to make it perfect and never knowing when to stop and call it done

Characters have 5 Harm (â™¥), Can have up to 5 Wounds, Can carry up to ten items and have a starting Wealth of 3.

Characters start with a weapon of choice, armor of choice, and a smart phone in their inventory. 

A Character should select one specialized piece of gear.

Characters are assumed to have two known locations
* Their residence -- a small apartment anywhere in the city
* Their place of employ -- if a character works from home you may choose a co-work location or some other known territory to work from ie: coffee shop, public library, colocation work center
    
Characters may start in one faction if their background suggests it, or is considered their place of employment (ie: city government or a bounty hunter association). The character should have a starting relationship with their faction that is up to two steps from _indifferent_ (0.0) 

Characters should start with a Character Arc -- something they are trying to achieve.

A character may have up to three known NPCs (family, employers, contacts, etc.).  Assign each known NPC a relationship status up to three steps away from _indifferent_ (0.0).
