# Wealth

Wealth is abstracted into categories. Your wealth is a measure of your your income. 

You may purchase any item without a roll if it is at or under you disposable income.

To purchase something that is above your disposable income, you can make a wealth check by passing a Level 3 plus each level above your current Wealth value (not disposable income). 
* If you successfully purchase the item your Disposable Wealth value will be reduced by 1 lowering how much you are able to freely spend.
* If you try to buy an item 2 steps or more above your wealth value and are successful in purchasing it move your wealth down by 1 in addition to lowering your disposable income.

When selling items found in your adventures, if the value of the item is at or less than your wealth value add +1 to your disposable income. If the item is above your wealth value add +1 to your overall wealth value.

The table below describes what each level of Wealth typically has. Your character may mix and match accommodations, but their wealth score is the highest of the values.

| Level | DC  | Description             | Housing                        | Transportation      | Disposable |

| 1     | 3   | Barely Making Ends Meet | Shared rented apartment        | Bike/Junker Vehicle | 0          |
| 2     | 6   | Getting By              | Small studio apartment         | Used economy car    | 1          |
| 3     | 9   | Comfortable             | Decent apartment or small home | Reliable car        | 2          |
| 4     | 12  | Well-Off                | Large home or upscale condo    | Luxury car          | 3          |

| 6     | 18  | Stupid Rich             | Many houses and estates        | Private airplane    | 5          |

> [!note]
> The Disposable column is the amount of disposable income a character has to spend on things outside their daily expenses.  Disposable can be modified if you increase or decrease an accommodation from the Wealth value by plus or minus 1 depending on the direction.

> [!example]
> All characters start with a Wealth score of 3.  However our character is a penny pincher and lives at the barest of means.  So if he lives in a studio apartment and uses public transportation to get around. 
> * A studio apartment is a 2 which will add +1 to Extra
> * Public transportation is a 0 which will add +1 to Extra
> 
> This character now has a +5 Disposable Income
> 
> Another character has a high-end sports car.
> * High-end sports car is a 5 which will add -1 to Extra (reduces by 1)
>
> This character now has a +2 Disposable Income



## Cost

Most items will have a Cost level and not an exact amount. You can use the chart below for real world (or from other sources) to determine what the items cost will be here.

| Level | DC  | Description    | Dollars/Credits       | Gold/Other              |
| ----- | --- | -------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 0     | 0   | Free           | $0                    | 0 gold                  |
| 1     | 3   | Inexpensive    | $0 - $100             | 0 - 10 gold             |
| 2     | 6   | Moderate       | $101 - $1,000         | 11 - 100 gold           |

| 6     | 18  | Priceless      | $1,000,001+           | 100,001+ gold or Unique |
> [!example]
> You want to purchase a new fangled smartphone. A smart phone is an Expensive item and your disposable income is 2. So you need to roll to see if you can successfully purchase it.
> 
> You roll against a level 3 plus one since it is not above your wealth score.  Rolling a 12 you pass the check and purchase the cell phone.  Your Extra is now 1.

## Income

Every player character should have enough income to survive with their base expenses.  Your income is your base Wealth value.  For the most part the income shouldn't change unless there are in game reasons for it to do so.
