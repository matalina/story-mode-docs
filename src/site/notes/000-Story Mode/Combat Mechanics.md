# Combat Mechanics

Player makes all rolls.  
* A player rolls to attack.  
* A player rolls to defend when a creature attacks.

A Player Character has 5 Harm (♥ ← alt+3) and can bear up to 5 Wounds before death.

NPCs and Creatures have Their Level of Harm (♥ ← alt+3) and can bear up to 3 Wounds before death.

Each wound hinders **ALL** rolls by 1 and reduces carrying capacity by 1.  If you have no empty slots and gain a new wound choose which item in your equipment to be dropped.

There are three types of damaging attack that each do a specific amount of harm. Heavy weapons reduce carrying capacity.

| Attack | Harm Done | Carrying Capacity Reduced |
| ------ | --------- | ------------------------- |
| Light  | 1 Harm    | 0                         |
| Medium | 2 Harm    | 0                         |
| Heavy  | 3 Harm    | 1                         |

When Harm reaches zero the creature takes 1 Wound and resets their harm to maximum level.  Harm extending past the remaining amount should be carried over when reset.

Wounds take 3 sessions (☼ ← alt+15) to heal.

Armor eases defense and hinders stealth and decreases carrying capacity by 1.

| Armor  | Ease Defense | Hinder Stealth | Carrying Capacity Reduced |
| ------ | ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------- |
| Light  | 1 step       | 0 steps        | 0                         |
| Medium | 2 steps      | 1 step         | 0                         |
| Heavy  | 3 steps      | 2 steps        | 1                         |
## Wounds

Wounds should reflect the type of attack that caused the damage to reduce the Harm to zero.

If for example you take damage from a sword. You might have a gaping wound in your side from the blow.

A wound can be treated in the field with an appropriate check. If successful the number of sessions require to heal the wound is reduced by one.  You may only heal one wound in this manner per session.

Wounds may be healed by magic unless otherwise stated. This will remove all but permanent wounds.  You may only heal one wound in this manner per session.

Wounds can be treated by someone with the appropriate knowledge.  This will reduce the number of sessions required to heal the wound by two. You may only heal one wound in this manner per session.
