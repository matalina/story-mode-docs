# Combat Mechanics

Player makes all rolls.  
* A player rolls to attack.  
* A player rolls to defend when a creature attacks.

A player can take 1 action and move a short distance on their turn in any given round.

At any time a player may quicken any action increasing the level of the task/check but allowing 2 actions in one round.  The task/check required for both actions is increased by one.

Each round a player may make one reaction to some event that happens while it is not their turn such as counter a spell or block an attack against an ally from a close creature.

## Initiative

Creatures initiative is determined by 3 times there level (their DC). 

Each Player will then roll their d20 using any modifications to ease or hinder their rolls. 

If the player rolls higher than the creature's DC they go first. 

If the player rolls lower than the creature. The creature goes first.

In a group, all players higher or lower than the creature decides the order they go. And the order can change each round with in the player group of higher or lower initiatives.

## Harm

A Player Character has 5 Harm (♥ ← alt+3) and can bear up to 5 Wounds before death.

NPCs and Creatures have Their Level of Harm (♥ ← alt+3) and can bear up to 3 Wounds before death.

Each wound hinders **ALL** rolls by 1 and reduces carrying capacity by 1.  If you have no empty slots and gain a new wound choose which item in your equipment to be dropped.

There are three types of damaging attack that each do a specific amount of harm. Heavy weapons reduce carrying capacity.

| Attack | Harm Done | Carrying Capacity Reduced |
| ------ | --------- | ------------------------- |
| Light  | 1 Harm    | 0                         |
| Medium | 2 Harm    | 0                         |
| Heavy  | 3 Harm    | 1                         |

When Harm reaches zero the creature takes 1 Wound and resets their harm to maximum level.  Harm extending past the remaining amount should be carried over when reset.

Armor eases defense and hinders stealth and decreases carrying capacity by 1.

| Armor  | Ease Defense | Hinder Stealth | Carrying Capacity Reduced |
| ------ | ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------- |
| Light  | 1 step       | 0 steps        | 0                         |
| Medium | 2 steps      | 1 step         | 0                         |
| Heavy  | 3 steps      | 2 steps        | 1                         |
## Wounds

Wounds should reflect the type of attack that caused the damage to reduce the Harm to zero.

If for example you take damage from a sword. You might have a gaping wound in your side from the blow.

A wound can be treated in the field with an appropriate check. If successful the number of nights required to heal the wound is reduced by one.  You may only heal one wound in this manner per session.

Wounds may be healed by magic unless otherwise stated. This will remove all but permanent wounds.  You may only heal one wound in this manner per session.

Wounds can be treated by someone with the appropriate knowledge.  This will reduce the number of nights required to heal the wound by two. You may only heal one wound in this manner per session.  

To heal a temporary wound, a character must rest in a safe zone  (☼ ← alt+15) for at least three nights. The nights do not need to be consecutive, and a character may adventure between rests, but the wound remains until fully healed.

> Safe zones are consider to be guarded settlements with proper lodgings.
