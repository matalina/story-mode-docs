# NPC Interactions

* Generate a NPC
* Choose a starting disposition by rolling on the d66 table, this is their starting disposition
* Modify the starting disposition towards the character by societal expectations.  _ie: magic is distrusted and you look like a magic user move 1 disposition to the right, you are a royal advisor who is well loved move the disposition 1 disposition down_
* For each time the character meets the NPC again roll 2d6.  And if the roll is higher or lower than the current disposition then move disposition in one step in the direction of the new roll.
