# Spellcasting

Any player character has access to magic if they so desire. Some are better at it than others.  All Spells start at Level 5 (DC of 15). The casting of each spell can be modified by the character tags.

A default base spell has the following properties.

**Level:** 5 (15)
**Range:** Short distance
**Damage:** 1 harm
**Area of Effect:** single
**Targets:** 1
**Duration:** 1 Round
**Cast Time:** 1 action

The chart below details how each option changes the level of the spell increasing the difficulty of it.  A spell's level cannot go above level 10 when creating it.

## Spells

Spells are a combination of Evocation and Domain.  To create a spell choose one from each list and detail what you want the spell to do.  Then you can start with the default spell structure and build it out from there.

When casting a spell you will also need to detail how you are casting it. Are you winging it? Do you have a scroll?  Did you learn it from someone else?  This step is not required if you've used this spell in prior sessions.
