# Story Mode

Story Mode is a quick and dirty story based game that uses some of the basic mechanics of the Cypher System to help you randomly tell a story.

You start each scene with a target rating, this is the difficulty of all elements in the scene. The Scene Status is a d6 roll and the target number is 3 times that roll. Simple and Easy!

You don't need any character sheets, rule-sets or anything other than your imagination and the ability to form yes and no questions.

The Oracle is based on a d20 roll with the following outcome table:

| d20   | Result   |
| ----- | -------- |
| 1     | No, and  |
| 2-9   | No, but  |
| 10-14 | Yes, but |
| 15-19 | Yes      |
| 20    | Yes, and |

If your characters need to preform a task that you want to randomize, just say what you are going to do and click the Check button. The Task will automatically be set to the Difficulty of the Scene and the outcome based on the following table, but you can always change the value.

| d20          | Result       | 1 (3) | 2 (6) | 3 (9) | 4 (12) | 5 (15) | 6 (18) |
| ------------ | ------------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1            | Fail, and    | 1     | 1     | 1     | 1      | 1      | 1      |
| 2 to DC-6    | Fail, but    | 2     | 2     | 2-3   | 2-6    | 2-9    | 2-13   |
| DC-5 to DC-1 | Success, but | --    | 3-5   | 4-12  | 7-11   | 10-14  | 13-17  |
| DC to DC+4   | Success      | 3-7   | 6-10  | 9-13  | 12-16  | 15-19  | 18-22  |
| DC+5 +       | Success, and | 8+    | 11+   | 14+   | 17+    | 20+    | 23+    |
## Modifying the Difficulty

The situation and things about your character can modify the target difficulty.  This is done by either easing the difficulty or hindering the difficulty.

**Easing:** Easing the difficulty means that you lower the level of the task being preformed.

**Hindering:** Hindering the difficulty means that you raise the level of the task being preformed.

Remember that the target number to hit is 3 times the level, so the target number is essentially lowered or raised by as many times as the task is eased or hindered.
