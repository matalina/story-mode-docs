# Monster Hunt

Setup a Game: 
* Generate the starting Location
* Generate the source
* Generate a Motive
* From the Motive Generate a Creature
* Generate a Final Encounter Location Type

When entering a location: 
1. Roll a scene status
2. Roll on the district/environment table
3. Reveal what's in the location. A clue will ease the scene status and a setback will hinder the scene.
    1. If the location type is the same as the final encounter type ask the oracle:
        * "Are there signs of the monster in this area?"
    2. Roll on the appropriate table to get an idea of what the clue or setback is.
4. Ask the oracle:
    * "Is there a point of interest here?"
    * "Is there something going on?" 
5. Resolve the scene
