# One Page Story Mode

## Basic Rules

* Every Scene has a level (roll a d4+2) that determines any undefined elements without a level
* All things (NPCs, items, spells, creatures etc) have a level and a sentence
* Players do all the rolling
* The DC for all tasks, checks, rolls is three times the level (Level * 3)
* If you are playing solo or gmless, the oracle is a Level 5 check (DC 15)
* Combat ends when the moment clock (5 + the number of PCs) is full, or the enemy has hit the party a number of times equal to the momentum clock (5 + the number of PCs)

## Resolution

Rolls 1d20 against the DC. The DC is equal to 3 times the Level of the task.

| d20          | Result       | Details                              |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| 1            | Fail, and    | Fail, and things are worse           |
| 2 to DC-6    | Fail, but    | Fail, but something else helps you   |
| DC-5 to DC-1 | Success, but | Success, but not exactly as expected |
| DC to DC+4   | Success      | Exactly as you expected              |
| DC+5 +       | Success, and | Success, and things are better       |
## Modifying the Difficulty

The situation and your character tags can modify the target difficulty.  This is done by either easing the difficulty or hindering the difficulty. 

Note: You ease/hinder the **level** of the task, not the DC.

**Easing:** Easing the difficulty means that you lower the level of the task being preformed.

**Hindering:** Hindering the difficulty means that you raise the level of the task being preformed.

Remember that the target number (DC) to hit is 3 times the level, so the target number is essentially lowered or raised by as many times as the task is eased or hindered.

## Levels of Difficulty

| Level | DC  | Description  |
| ----- | --- | ------------ |
| 0     | 0   | Routine      |
| 1     | 3   | Simple       |
| 2     | 6   | Standard     |
| 3     | 9   | Demanding    |
| 4     | 12  | Difficult    |
| 5     | 15  | Challenging  |
| 6     | 18  | Intimidating |
| 7     | 21  | Formidable   |
| 8     | 24  | Heroic       |
| 9     | 27  | Immortal     |
| 10    | 30  | Impossible   |

## Combat Mechanics

Player makes all rolls.  

A player and creature can take 1 action and move a 30ft on their turn in any given round.

Each round a player may make one reaction to some event that happens while it is not their turn such as counter a spell or block an attack against an ally from a creature with in 5ft.

### Initiative

Creatures initiative is determined by 3 times there level (their DC). 

Each Player will then roll their d20 using any modifications to ease or hinder their rolls. 

If the player rolls higher than the creature's DC they go first. 

If the player rolls lower than the creature. The creature goes first.

If the player matches the DC of the creature initiative the player goes first.

In a group, all players higher or lower than the creature decides the order they go. And the order can change each round with in the player group of higher or lower initiatives.

### Armor

Armor eases defense and hinders stealth and decreases carrying capacity by 1.

| Armor  | Ease Defense | Hinder Stealth | Carrying Capacity Reduced |
| ------ | ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------- |
| Light  | 1 step       | 0 steps        | 0                         |
| Medium | 2 steps      | 1 step         | 0                         |
| Heavy  | 3 steps      | 2 steps        | 1                         |
### Momentum

During combat the scene has a Momentum clock equal to 5 plus the number of PCs in the scenario.  Using the table below to adjust the clock.  The clock starts at zero. And the sequence ends when the clock is filled or when the enemies total number of successes equals the momentum clock total (5 plus the number of PCs).

| d20          | Result       | Player Attack | Player Defense                 |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 1            | Fail, and    | 0             | -2 momentum/+2 enemy succeses  |
| 2 to DC-6    | Fail, but    | 0             | -1 momentum/+1 enemy successes |
| DC-5 to DC-1 | Success, but | 0             | -1 momentum/+0 enemy successes |
| DC to DC+4   | Success      | +1 momentum   | 0                              |
| DC+5 +       | Success, and | +2 momentum   | 0                              |
A successful player attack increases momentum.

A failed player defense decreases momentum and adds to the enemies total number of success.

At the end of combat, the total number of successful hits on the enemies clock is the amount of 'damage' the party received.  Using the wounds table decide what wound the characters receive.

| Segments | 1 PC                | 2 PC                | 3 PC                | 4+ PCs              |

| 7        | --                  | Lasting Scar        | Debilitating Injury | Lingering Trauma    |
| 8        | --                  | --                  | Lasting Scar        | Debilitating Injury |
| 9+       | --                  | --                  | --                  | Lasting Scar        |

### Wounds

Wounds are tags that hinder appropriate actions and tasks.  

A wound can be treated in the field by successfully passing a Level 5 Field treatment check. For each attempt after the first the task is hindered by one for each additional try. On a successful check you may heal 1 strain, or downgrade 1 other wound except a Lasting Scar.

You may Field treat a wound only directly after combat.  You may not try again in another scene.

Wounds can be treated by someone with the appropriate knowledge (doctor/barber etc) with a Level 3 Treat Injury check. For each attempt after the first the task is hindered by one for each additional try. On a successful check strains and lingering traumas are removed or one debilitating injury is downgraded to a lingering trauma.

You may only be treated by a professional once per session.

Wounds may be healed by magic by someone skilled in the magical healing arts. On a successful check all wounds except any Lasting Scars are healed, or 1 Lasting Scar that can be healed is healed. However, if a Lasting Scar with a missing body part is immediately healed after the fight AND the missing body part is present, the wound can be healed completely. If any time elapses, the missing piece may not be reattached and the character should apply a new tag such as can't see out of right eye, or can't hear out of left ear, has a peg leg or some other tag that represents their new condition in order to remove the Lasting Scar penalty.

You may only be healed magically once per session.

Lasting Scars may only be healed with magic or over a Long Downtime period of rest and healing.

When a character rests in a safe zone, they can heal all strains or 1 Lingering Trauma or downgrade 1 Debilitating Injury to a Lingering Trauma.
