A Half-blood does not take on the full characterizations of their parental species, instead they fill out the following sentence to add to their character sheet.

They can **\[take all the magical abilities of both races]** and are shaped by **\[which ever species raises them]**. \[Name] also has **\[both flaws of each species]** and speaks **\[with one species voice]**.

**Languages:** English, \[pick one of the species other languages]

**Abilities:**

* \[pick an ability from either species]

Half-bloods pull from both species in terms of physical characteristics. The player is free to pick and choose as they see fit.
