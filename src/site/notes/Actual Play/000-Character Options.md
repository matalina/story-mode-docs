## Half-bloods

Ferai, Aelith, Noctari and Drakari can all mate successfully with one another producing half-bloods.  Half-bloods take on characteristics of their parentage and are often **ostracized by both communities** for being different.

\[Name] is half \[pick a species] and \[pick a species]. 

A Half-blood does not take on the full characterizations of their parental species, instead they fill out the following sentence to add to their character sheet.

They are **\[pick one from father's species]** and **\[pick one from mother's species]**. They can **\[take all the magical abilities of both races]** and are shaped by **\[which ever species raises them]**. \[Name] also has **\[both flaws of each species]**.

**Languages:** English, \[pick one of the species other languages]

Half-bloods are rare in the Wyld, the Nether and the Iron Veil. A few live in New Everlight.

Half-bloods pull from both species in terms of physical characteristics. The player is free to pick and choose as they see fit.

> [!example]
> Sarah is a half Drakari and Noctari and is **ostracized by both communities**
> 
> They are **formidable** and **mysterious**. They can **shapeshift**, use **fire magic** and are connected to **magic** and **shadows** and are **shaped by the flames**. Sarah is **vulnerable to silver** and **prideful**.

> **Languages:** English, Drakari
