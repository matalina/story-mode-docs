\- There are a number of cards that are not laid out in the grid but exist outside of it.

\* The four corners of the 5x5 map have subway access. The center card also has subway access.  You can jump to the off grid subway card for 1 Shift, resolve subway encounter as usual, and then move to any of the other subway access points for 1 Shift.

\+ You can travel home for free once per day, afterwards you may travel home through the subway. This resets after each rest.

\^ You can travel to work for free once per day, afterwards you may travel home through the subway. This resets after each rest.

## Travel

There are 10 Shifts per day that allows you to travel through New Everlight.  Each district type has a [[#^d0a29b|cost]].

The cost of travel is to enter a new region, not leaving it.

You may travel between home and work as many times as you like.

Traveling straight up, down, right, or left, costs the amount of shifts for the district you are moving into.  

Traveling diagonally, costs the amount of shifts for the district you are moving into plus 1.

When you can no longer use your Shifts to move, you must go home to rest. You may use your free home or work travel if it's available, otherwise you will incur a penalty. 

**Penalty for Exceeding Shifts**

- If you fail to return home before running out of shifts, you suffer a -2 shift penalty on the following day’s total available shifts and gain the [[Actual Play/Fractured Veil/Tags#^3b3b52\|Exhausted]] Condition Tag.  
- This penalty does not stack.
- The Exhausted condition remains until you successfully return home within your allotted shifts per day.

### Travel Procedure

When traveling into a hex use the following procedure.

1. Flip over all face down adjacent cards.
2. Roll 1d4+2 to determine the level of the scene. (Anything without a level will use this as their level).
3. Roll for a Point of Interest Type.
4. Resolve the situation created.
5. If you have more travel shifts left in the day go to another card and start back at #1.
6. If you do not have enough travel shifts, you must [[#Rest Procedure|rest]].
7. After resolving the Rest start over at #1.

### Rest Procedure

For an urban encounter it is considered a safe zone, thus we will allow each party member 2 down time activities and the possibility of a safe zone encounter.

1. Each party member can choose to do 2 [[004-MTG Method/Downtime\|downtime]] activities and get a full nights rest barring any interruptions. (In the wilderness, one downtime activity should be a watch).
2. Each party member should roll on the Rest Encounter table to determine what happens. If your rest is interrupted you gain the [[Actual Play/Fractured Veil/Tags#^3b3b52\|Exhausted]] Condition Tag. This condition is removed only after a full night’s rest is completed without interruption. (Note: This does not incur the -2 penalty on Shifts.)
3. If you are tracking resources, reduce your rations and water by one.
