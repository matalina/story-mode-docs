# Species

## Ferai

The Ferai are humans in the mortal realm. They are the most predominate species there and they have many countries and many governments.

## Aelith

The Aelith live in The Wyld. They rarely venture to other planes as they are all too depressing and cold. The Aelith are ruled by two Courts, every Aelith belongs to one or the other faction, to not belong is to be exiled and forgotten.

## Noctari

The Noctari live in The Nether. They long to leave home and many do, finding refuge in The Wild or the Iron Veil. The Noctari are governed by individual Shrouds that are almost always at war. The two largest Shrouds are [[Actual Play/Fractured Veil/Lore#The Gloomweavers\|The Gloomweavers]] and [[Actual Play/Fractured Veil/Lore#The Shadowborn\|The Shadowborn]].

## Drakari

The Drakari are a matriarchal society. Each clan is governed by the strongest and largest female of the Clan.

Female Drakari have notably bigger dragon forms than their male counterparts, but they choose to have smaller Ferai (human) forms to blend in.
