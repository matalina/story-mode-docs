# Café Noir
[[Actual Play/Fractured Veil/New Everlight/Everlight Commons\|Everlight Commons]] - 3.10

> Café Noir was like stepping back into the 1920s in some old detective flick. The whole place was a black and white motif with splashes of muted red like color was first being introduced into a black and white world. Soft Jazz music played through the speakers. And it smelled of nothing but brewing coffee. 
> 
> Sure, they had pastries and fancy smoothies, but it was all about the coffee -- a special blend found across the Faerie Mound. Or at least that's what they said.

## Menu

### Coffee

#### The Flatfoot

_A straight-laced black coffee with no frills. Bold, bitter, and always watching the door._  
— A classic drip brewed with the café’s Velshade bean blend. No cream. No sugar. Just questions.

#### The Femme Fatale

_Dark, rich, and dangerously smooth._  
— Espresso kissed with smoked vanilla and a splash of cream, topped with just a hint of cherry foam. Served in a glass cup with a lipstick stain already on it.

#### The Red Herring

_It’s not what you think—but you’ll come back for another look._  
— A raspberry mocha with dark chocolate and a swirl of cayenne. Sweet, then spicy. It lingers like doubt.

#### The Long Goodbye

_Served cold. Strong enough to keep you awake through every regret._  
— Iced cold brew aged 24 hours in a dark glass jar, poured over a single cube of clear ice. Comes with a chocolate cigarette on the saucer.

#### The Private Eye

_Black, bold, and a little smoky._  
— A rich Americano infused with charred oak essence and a hint of bourbon extract (non-alcoholic, unless you’ve got the password).

#### The Fade to Black

_It starts sweet… but don’t expect a happy ending._  
— A sweetened condensed milk cortado served with a cocoa dusting and a dark chocolate stir stick. Great for newcomers. Or farewells.

### Smoothies

#### The Blush and Thorn

_It flirts with sweetness before the tart sets in._  
— A bold blend of Blushberry and ripe strawberries with a squeeze of lemon. Refreshing and sharp, served with a sugared rim.

#### Moondrop Chill

_Cold as moonlight and twice as smooth._  
— Moondrop melon blended with cucumber and honeydew, finished with a touch of mint. Light, cooling, and crisp.

#### Gloamgold Swirl

_The taste of a sunset you almost forgot._  
— Roasted Gloamfruit purée blended with peach and a splash of orange juice. Creamy and warm with a hint of vanilla.

#### Bramblekiss

_Rich enough to stain your memory._  
— Juicy Nightberry blended with blackberry and red grape. Dark and lush with a velvety finish. Served with a twist of citrus peel.

#### Mirelight Zing

_Electric. Unexpected. Still tingling._  
— Tart Mirefruit blended with green apple and fresh ginger. A bright, punchy wake-up call with a sparkle of lime.

## Pastries

#### The Velvet Crime

_It melts on your tongue and hides the evidence._  
— A rich dark chocolate torte layered with Nightberry compote and dusted with black cocoa powder. Topped with a shard of tempered chocolate that cracks like glass.

#### The Yellow Note

_Bright, biting, and impossible to ignore._  
— A lemon tart with a shortbread crust and a smooth Mirefruit glaze. Tart enough to make you blink, sweet enough to keep going back.

#### Whisper Pockets

_They look innocent. That’s the trick._  
— Flaky hand pies filled with stewed Foxapple and cinnamon, served warm with a sugared top. Best eaten while watching the door.

#### Pale Hours

_Soft, light, gone before you know it._  
— Airy Moondrop melon chiffon cake with whipped cream and slivered almonds. Served chilled, dusted in powdered sugar like moonlight.

#### Red Hand Scone

_Sticky fingers tell stories._  
— A crumbly scone with swirls of Blushberry jam and white chocolate chips. Glazed lightly with rosewater icing and served warm.

## Magic Shots

#### The Fogcutter

_For mornings after nights you can't quite remember._  
— Brewed from shredded Driftroot, ginger, and salted elderberry. Relieves hangovers, eases light headaches, and cuts the haze without judging your choices. Best stirred into a dark roast or citrus-based smoothie.

#### Low Note

_You may not feel brave, but you’ll sound like it._  
— Distilled Voicebark resin in a honey base. Smooths speech and deepens tone for a few hours. Popular before poetry nights. Drop it into mochas or nut-based drinks.

#### Shadowslip

_The world won’t look away—but it might overlook._  
— Infused with Duskcap, black vanilla, and a drop of shadowmelt. Gives a subtle blending effect, like people stop noticing you unless you speak. Works best in cold brews and black teas.

#### Lucid Bloom

_When you need clarity, or at least better guesses._  
— A floral, citrusy shot from Glasspetal blossom and orange zest. Heightens focus, good for overthinkers and late-night planners. Pairs well with lemon, cucumber, or melon-based drinks.

#### Ashlight

_Like smoking a memory._  
— A charcoal-hued shot made with Cindermint and black tea. Brings a subtle sense of calm and nostalgia. Best in anything chocolate or spiced.
