# Urban Flats
Middle Class Residential

#### 5.9 
Middle Class Residential

**Tone:** Lived-in, Chaotic, Fragmented
- **Sight:** Tall apartment buildings with worn facades, flickering streetlights casting shadows over cracked sidewalks, children playing in small public areas, and the occasional scuffle between neighbors  
- **Sound:** Cars honking in the distance, people shouting across balconies, the constant hum of electronics, distant music leaking from windows 
- **Smell:** A mix of food aromas wafting from open windows, fresh laundry, stale air from older apartments, occasionally the sharp scent of industrial cleaners 
- **Touch:** Worn door handles, the frayed fabric of couches, a subtle vibration from the constant flow of traffic outside
- **Taste:** Coffee brewing from a neighbor’s window, quick and greasy takeout food, cheap but strong liquor

Slums

**Tone:** Overcrowded, Sorrowful, Dangerous
- **Sight:** Dilapidated buildings packed closely together, trash spilling onto the streets, cracked pavement leading to unsafe areas, a mixture of humanity and hardship
- **Sound:** Yelling from angry tenants, the clatter of metal on metal, sirens wailing in the distance, the clinking of old shopping carts filled with people’s lives
- **Smell:** Strong stench of rotting garbage, human waste, burned-out structures, mixed with an occasional scent of smoke from impromptu fires
- **Touch:** Sticky walls, sharp debris underfoot, the sharp edge of broken glass that clings to cracked windows
- **Taste:** Dry, stale air, the bitter tang of pollution, sour water from nearby pipes
