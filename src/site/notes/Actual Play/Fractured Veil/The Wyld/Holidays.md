# Holidays

**The Wyld Masque** - a celebration held twice a year (spring, fall) at the Twilight Glade where all members of the court pay tribute to their king and queen.

**The Wyldflame Festival**  - a day celebrating the Wyld and the Goddess of the Wyld, The Mother of Blooming Chaos. (fall)

**The Emberwake** - a day celebrating chaotic magic and the Trickster God, Father of the Laughing Flame. Pacts made on this day are stronger. Magic performed is prone to mishaps, but the results are stronger and more powerful. (summer)
