# The Wyld
A wild and magical realm full of whimsy and fantasy

**Predominant Race:** [[Actual Play/Fractured Veil/Lore-Species#Aelith\|Aelith]] (Fey Elf)

While creatures not native to The Wyld visit, the **Echoes of Laughter** tag always applies.

Time flows chaotically in The Wyld. One day in there could be three in The Iron Veil, or it could be a matter of hours there. It is unpredictable. 

[[Actual Play/Fractured Veil/Items#The Great Bells\|The Great Bells]] of the Twilight Glade ring four times a year -- once for each seasonal equinox. Though the seasons in the Wyld are not the same as those found in the Iron Veil.
* Spring -- High Magic, Low Growth (rings once)
* Summer -- High Magic, High Growth (rings twice)
* Fall -- Low Magic, Low Growth (rings three times)
* Winter -- Low Magic, No Growth (rings four times)

There are two courts in the Wyld who rule over the people and creatures of its realm. The Leaders of [[Actual Play/Fractured Veil/Lore-Factions#The Gilded Chain\|the Gilded Chain]] and [[Actual Play/Fractured Veil/Lore-Factions#The Whispered Hand\|the Whispered Hand]] rule together as king and queen. Twice a year they hold court in [[Actual Play/Fractured Veil/Lore-Locations#The Twilight Glade\|The Twilight Glade]] between territories. All members of the court are expected to come and pay tribute to their [[Actual Play/Fractured Veil/NPCs#Lucian Vaelric\|King]] and [[Actual Play/Fractured Veil/NPCs#Variana Thorne\|Queen]].
