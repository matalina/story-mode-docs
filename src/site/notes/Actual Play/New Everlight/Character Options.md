### Half-bloods

Half-bloods are rare in the Wyld, the Nether and the Iron Veil. A few live in New Everlight.

Ferai, Aelith, Noctari and Drakari can all mate successfully with one another producing half-bloods.  Half-bloods take on characteristics of their parentage and are often **ostracized by both communities** for being different.

\[Name] is half _\[pick a species]_ and _\[pick a species]_ who is **ostracized by both communities**. 

A Half-blood does not take on the full characterizations of their parental species, instead they fill out the following sentence to add to their character sheet.

They are **\[pick one from father's species]** and **\[pick one from mother's species]**. They can **\[take all the magical abilities of both races]** and are shaped by **\[which ever species raises them]**. \[Name] also has **\[both flaws of each species]** and speaks **\[with one species voice]**.

**Languages:** English, \[pick one of the species other languages]

**Abilities:**
* \[pick an ability from either species]
* \[pick an ability from either species]

Half-bloods pull from both species in terms of physical characteristics. The player is free to pick and choose as they see fit.

> [!example]
> Sarah is a half _Drakari_ and _Noctari_ and is **ostracized by both communities**
> 
> They are **formidable** and **mysterious**. They can **shapeshift**, use **fire magic** and are connected to **magic** and **shadows** and are **shaped by the flames**. Sarah is **vulnerable to silver** and **prideful** and speaks with a **rough, gritty voice**.
> 
> **Languages:** English, Drakari
> 
> **Abilities:**
> * **Walk Between Shadows**
> * **Speak Telepathically**
> 
> Sarah has bright golden hair to match her golden scales, violet eyes and pale gray skin.

Half-bloods may add any of the characteristics and abilities not used by the umbrella tag as one of their background or additional tags.
