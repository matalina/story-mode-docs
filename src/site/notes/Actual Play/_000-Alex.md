* Drakari??
* Alex always wanted to be a singer. He went to the July 4th, 1985 celebration at 12 to busk for the first time. He was boo'd and hissed at and totally discouraged. When the chaos erupted Alex transformed in the case figuring no one would notice revealing the existence of Dragons to the world. Because of this event Alex sought out an Aelith to grant him a wish -- to have the most beautiful voice.
