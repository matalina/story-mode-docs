## Made Up Language

Nox used the native Faerie and Noctari language he learned from the shadows to make up his own 'magic/ritual phrases' 

**Core Elements of the Language:**
- **Noctari sounds:** Soft, breathy consonants (h, v, th, sh), elongated vowels, and glottal stops (‘).
- **Faerie sounds:** Flowing, musical tones with a mix of **hard consonants (k, l, r, d, t)** and **vowel-heavy syllables**.
- **Sentence structure:** **Verb-Subject-Object**  Forge Shadow Weapon -- Forge Shadow into a Sword
