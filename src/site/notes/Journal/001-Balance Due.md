> 
> New Everlight police are investigating the mysterious death of local financier **Victor Langley**, who was found dead last night in his high-rise office at Langley & Associates. Authorities remain tight-lipped about the circumstances, but sources say the scene left more questions than answers.
> 
> Langley, 62, was last seen leaving a late business meeting, alone. Security footage confirms no one entered or exited his 28th-floor office between 9:30 PM and when a janitor discovered his body at 6:15 AM. The door was locked from the inside, and there were no signs of forced entry. The only disturbance? The blinds, which were drawn shut hours earlier, had been left wide open.
> 
> "It doesn't make sense," said Detective **Elliot Vance**, lead investigator on the case. "The victim had no visible injuries, no indications of struggle. Yet, something clearly happened here. We’re pursuing all possible leads."
> 
> A source close to the investigation described Langley’s expression as _“one of pure terror.”_ His hands were clenched tight around his desk, as if bracing himself against something unseen. The only clue left behind was a single phrase scrawled across his financial ledger in shaking, uneven handwriting: **“The Debt is Due.”**
> 
> Employees claim Langley had been increasingly paranoid in recent weeks, speaking of _“old debts”_ and unseen figures watching him. His longtime assistant, **Eleanor Price**, said he had been reviewing old accounts—some dating back decades—but she was unaware of any threats or outstanding disputes.
> 
> The coroner has yet to determine an official cause of death. No signs of poison, trauma, or natural causes have been confirmed. Authorities urge anyone with information to come forward.
> 
> Was Langley the target of an elaborate scheme, a victim of his own fears—or something more sinister? As the investigation unfolds, residents of New Everlight are left wondering: _Can a debt follow you beyond the grave?_
