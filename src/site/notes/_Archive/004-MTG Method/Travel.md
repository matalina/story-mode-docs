## Travel Procedure

When traveling into a hex use the following procedure.

1. **For a Hex:** Draw Terrain for each of the empty adjacent hexes.
   **For Carta Style:** Flip over all face down adjacent cards.
2. Roll 1d4+2 to determine the level of the scene. (Anything without a level will use this as their level).
3. Roll for weather.
4. Roll for a Point of Interest Type.
5. Resolve the situation created.
6. If you have more travel left in the day go to another hex/card and start back at #1.
7. If you do not have more to travel, you must [[#Rest Procedure|rest]].
8. After resolving the Rest start over at #1.

# Rest Procedure

A rest consists of a number of rounds equal to 1 plus the number of players. If you are out in the wilderness we highly advise that each character takes a watch as a downtime activity.

1. Each party member can choose to do 2 [[_Archive/004-MTG Method/Downtime\|downtime]] activities and get a full nights rest barring any interruptions. (In the wilderness, one downtime activity should be a watch).
2. Determine how many times to roll for a random encounter using the following equation.
   \# of rounds - \# of players
   
   This should be at least 1, but if a player does not take a watch you may have more possibility of rolling an encounter. 
3. Roll on the appropriate Rest encounter table to determine what happens.
4. If you are tracking resources, reduce your rations and water by one.
